# Steps to Install Sass

This script documents the process of installing Sass in a Node.js environment.

**Initial Attempt as per instructions:**

The instruction was to run:
`npm install sass -v 3.7.4`

**Result of initial attempt:**
This command failed with an `ETARGET` error, indicating "No matching version found for sass@3.7.4". This suggests that version `3.7.4` of the `sass` package (Dart Sass) does not exist on the npm registry. The `-v` flag was also incorrectly used in the original command for specifying a package version.

**Corrected Installation Method (Installing the latest stable Sass):**

To successfully install Sass (Dart Sass, the recommended and actively maintained version), the following steps were taken:

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\susan\ALX-Pro-Dev\0x03-sass_scss
    ```
    (Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on the system.)

2.  **Install the latest stable version of the `sass` package as a local project dependency:**
    ```bash
    npm install sass
    ```
    This command successfully installed Sass into the `node_modules` directory of the project.

3.  **Verify the Sass installation and functionality:**
    Since `sass` is installed as a local dependency, it's executed using `npx`, which allows running executables from the `node_modules/.bin` directory.

    ```bash
    npx sass --version
    ```

    **Observed Output:**
    `1.89.2 compiled with dart2js 3.8.1`
    (Note: The version number may vary depending on the latest stable release at the time of installation.)

**Conclusion:**

Sass is now successfully installed and callable within the project context using `npx`. The specific version `3.7.4` requested in the initial instruction was found to be unavailable.
